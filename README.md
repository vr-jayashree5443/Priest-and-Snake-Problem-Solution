1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code starts by taking the input for the number of rows and columns (N) and the number of snakes (M).
   - It then iteratively takes input for each snake's initial position (start_block) and final position (end_block).

2. **Snake Movement Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the movement direction for each snake based on the start and end positions.
   - It then creates a list (`snake_info_list_going_dir`) containing the movement direction for each snake.

3. **Full Snake Blocks Calculation:**
   - For each snake, the code calculates the full list of blocks the snake occupies based on its initial and final positions.

4. **Moving Snakes Per Unit:**
   - There is a function `movr_per_unit` that takes the snake information list and the movement direction list and calculates the new position of each snake after moving one unit.

5. **Iterative Snake Movement:**
   - The code iterates for N units, calculating the new position of each snake in each iteration.

6. **Priest's Starting Position:**
   - The code takes input for the priest's starting position and direction.

7. **Priest Movement and Collision Check:**
   - The code simulates the movement of the priest one step at a time, checking for collisions with snake positions at each step.
   - If a collision is detected, it prints the position where the collision occurred and breaks out of the loop.

8. **Nirvana Check:**
   - If no collision is detected after the priest's movement, it prints "NIRVANA" indicating that the priest successfully reached the other side of the matrix.

The code uses functions to organize the logic, making it modular. It simulates the movement of both snakes and the priest, checking for collisions and printing the appropriate output.
